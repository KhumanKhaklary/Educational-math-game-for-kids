# MathKidsGame DApp

## Project Title
**Educational Math Game for Kids** - A blockchain-based educational platform that makes learning mathematics fun and rewarding for children.

## Project Description
MathKidsGame is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to make mathematics learning enjoyable and engaging for kids. The platform gamifies basic mathematical operations like addition and subtraction, allowing children to solve problems, track their progress, and earn rewards for their achievements. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures transparent scoring, permanent progress tracking, and creates a trustworthy environment for educational growth.

## Project Vision
To teach kids from a young age the basics of mathematics in a fun and interactive way that they love. Our vision is to transform traditional math learning into an exciting adventure where children can build confidence, develop problem-solving skills, and establish a strong foundation in mathematics through gamification and positive reinforcement.
